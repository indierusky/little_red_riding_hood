Background


Little Red Riding Hood is a game that is a spin off of a kid’s fairy tale.  The game will be a one player game.  It will begin with Little red riding hood facing two paths or more to get to grandma’s house where she must bring her grandma who is weak some nourishment.  One path will have a barrier which will be the big bad wolf and Little Red Riding Hood must avoid the big bad wolf to get to grandma’s.  Advanced levels may involve a time limit where Little Red Riding Hood must get to grandma’s before the big bad wolf who will also be in route.  The game will have the following rules:


	•	A player must avoid big bad wolf

	•	A player must get to grandma’s

	•	A player dies if they collide with big bad wolf

	•	A player dies if big bad wolf gets to grandma’s first




Functionality & MVP

 Playing Little Red Riding Hood users may:

	•	Start, pause and reset game if wrong route is chosen

	•	Choose between different paths to Grandma’s 

	•	Move up, down, right or left to travel along path to Grandma’s



In addition, this project will include:

	•	An about modal describing background and rules

	•	A production README


Wireframes

This app will be a single screen app with a game board  and game controls.  The app  will include nav links to my Github, my LinkedIn, and the about modal. 
 The game controls will include start, stop and reset buttons.  A user will be able to use the arrow keys to move along the path to grandma’s.

Architecture and Technologies

Javascript for game logic

HTML5 Canvas for board set up

Sprite Characters 


In addition to the entry file, there will be three scripts involved in this project:

  board.js: this script handles the logic updating the path and the 

    player.js: this script handles the logic of creating Little Red Riding Hood  

    wolf.js:  this script handles the logic of creating the wolf



Day 1:  Create little red riding hood character and class logic.

Day 2: Create Wolf character and class logic as well as board set up.

Day:3 Create logic for controlling characters and game controls.


Day:4 Create collision detection logic and insure it works correctly.


Day:5 Bring everything together and makes sure functionality is sound.



Bonus feature:


Create multiple levels with multiple paths and also allow for speed increase as well as time constraint where wolf can become faster.
